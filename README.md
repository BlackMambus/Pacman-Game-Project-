# Pacman-Game-Project-

ðŸŸ¡ Pac-Man Game Project Overview Creating a Pac-Man game is a classic way to dive into game development and sharpen your programming skills. Whether you're using C, Python, or another language, the project involves building a maze-based game where the player controls Pac-Man to eat pellets while avoiding ghosts.

ðŸŽ® Core Gameplay Elements:
Maze Layout: A grid-based map with walls, paths, and pellets.

Pac-Man Movement: Controlled via keyboard (arrow keys or WASD), navigating the maze.

Ghosts: Enemies that chase Pac-Man; collision ends the game.

Scoring System: Points awarded for eating pellets and power-ups.

Game Over Conditions: Triggered when Pac-Man is caught by a ghost or all pellets are eaten.
